# MODX Development Docker

Docker setup that makes it easier to develop MODX from GitHub.

Simply clone [MODX Revolution](https://github.com/modxcms/revolution) into this folder and run Docker compose and you are all set. Setup described below.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Note that Docker compose is included in the Docker Toolbox, so if you install that you do not need to install the stand alone version.

## Setup
